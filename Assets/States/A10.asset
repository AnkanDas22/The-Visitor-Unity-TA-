  text: "He gets back on his car.\r\nHe pushes on the gas, and turns around to drive
    back to where he came from.\r\nHe notices that the trucks are still on the path
    back, a logo on each of them shining from the moonlight shimmering between the
    dense coverage overhead.\r\nHe fails to recognize the logo from anywhere, but
    it might be some social service group, atleast it looks the kind.\r\nHe narrowly
    overtakes the long lineup of trucks moving almost uniformly.\r\nOnce he reaches
    the point where it had branched off, he takes the left road up hoping for a place
    to stay for the night."
