  text: "He takes the right road up.\r\nDriving by, he notices a now non-operational,
    old petrol station but it reminds him of something.\r\nThis must be the way to
    his grandma's house.\r\nHe ponders over the gas station, he remembers it as the
    only place nearby with the chocolate filled candies.\r\nHe'd often come around
    the gas station to collect the candy they used to give away when he used to visit
    his grandma's place.\r\nHe soon reaches his grandma's house, but the lights seem
    to be off.\r\nHe gets down and reaches the porch, when a few trucks heads off
    in the direction he came from.\r\nLane carefully knocks on the door, afraid his
    grandma might be asleep and might be shaken.\r\nMinutes go by, yet no one responds.
    He decides to:\r\n1(A10): Get back on the car and drive back and take the left
    road up to look for a place to stay\r\n2(A11): Check the neighbor's house, the
    only other settlement nearby"
