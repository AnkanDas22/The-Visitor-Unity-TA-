  text: "Lane pushes the breaks, and the car slowly comes to a halt.\r\nAs soon as
    it does, a deer hurriedly runs across from the right of the thicket to the left.\r\nLane
    feels glad that he had stopped, otherwise who knows what might have happened.\r\nHe
    grasps the roll with his left hand, and takes out the metallic electronic lighter
    to his face and lights up the cigarette.\r\nIt's almost magically that he had
    forgotten all his worries, breathing through the smoke inside his car, when he
    realized he hadn't opened the car windows.\r\nHe quickly pulls down the rattling
    windows, letting out the smoke and throws the cigarette out on the road.\r\nAs
    he's about to close the windows, a herd of deer again runs across the road in
    front of his car.\r\nWasting not another second, he starts up the car and gets
    going."
