  text: "Lane keeps driving, without offering himself the relief of tension that he
    very much needed.\r\nA herd of deer rushes across and slams against the car and
    breaks the windshield [WINDSHIELD: Broken/False].\r\nWithout taking even another
    second, Lane tries to drive the car forward but it is stuck.\r\nHe goes out in

    True]: Put it in the trunk of his car.\r\n2[DEER: False]: Move it aside and get
