  text: "Lane is driving through the woods, on a rough, now barely concrete road.\r\nA
    doll, almost torn and dilapidated, keeps moving side to side like a pendulum on
    a string.\r\nThe radio playing his age-old tunes, that still reminds him of his
    holiday visits to this place.\r\nThere's almost a strange acquaintance that he
    feels with this place he had visited long ago.\r\nThe jerking of the car makes
    him nauseous. Lane feels like a bit sick from all the driving.\r\nDo you stop
    and smoke a cigarette in the middle of nowhere?\r\n\r\n1. Why not?\r\n2. Definitely
    not!"
