  text: "Lane gets down from the porch, and heads outside and walks a bit to get to
    the neighor's house.\r\nWhen he used to visit, there was only a middle-aged man
    living there in his family of four.\r\nHe doesn't obviously expect anyone to live
    there anymore since the kids would have been grown up and settled somewhere else
    with their parents.\r\nHe still goes ahead and rings the mechanical bell, oddly
    enough it hasn't been upgraded since.\r\nThe sound almost reverbates through the
    walls of the house.\r\nAgain, this place seems to have been abandoned.\r\nHe's
    leaving when he notices a small, black bag which looks to have been recently left
    there.\r\nInvestigate?\r\n1(A12): Yeah, maybe someone from the family visited\r\n2(A13):
    No, let's just go"
