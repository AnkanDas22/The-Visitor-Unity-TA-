  text: "Lane tells the driver that he really needs a place to stay.\r\nThe truck
    driver, without even hesitating, tells Lane to follow him in, with a surprising
    warmth in this voice.\r\nThe security guard responds to Lane's goodnight wish
    with a nod, then tells him the directions.\r\nLane parks his car in the old parking
    lot. There were marks and tears on the walls.\r\nIt was undoubtedly an old settlement,
    particularly evident from all the signs of old timer rock bands scribbled on the
    walls.\r\nYet considering it's probably corporate property, it's surprising they
    haven't renovated even a bit.\r\nSounds like a business going downhill, but the
    trucks clearly seemed to have well paid workers.\r\nHe heads outside."
