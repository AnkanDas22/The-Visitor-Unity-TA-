  text: "Lane gets out of the car, and very weirdly, there is nothing there.\r\nNot
    even a trace of fur.\r\nNot a single drop of blood.\r\nDid you just dream it all?\r\nMaybe,
    it's all his nausea acting up. Lane decides to take a smoke.\r\nHe grasps the
    roll with his left hand, and takes out the metallic electronic lighter to his
    face and lights up the cigarette.\r\nHe gets back on his car, and evidently, there's
    no damage on the windshield."
