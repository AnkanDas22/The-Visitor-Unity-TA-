  text: "As Lane moves up the road, it seems that the ground is rougher than it was
    before.\r\nThe fact that there seems to be no human presence around the place
    is scary enough.\r\nWhat travels these roads, then? How is it in this state?\r\nHe
    keeps driving, without further thought, as he reaches the end of the road.\r\nThere's
    a sign reading \"Restricted\" in big, red bold letters right before opening into
    a big, open field.\r\nIn the distance, there seems to be metallic bunkers all
    around.\r\n1(A7): Look up what this place is all about.\r\n2(A6): Better get going,
    no time to mess around"
